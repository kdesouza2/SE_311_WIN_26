<!-- Note to Self: Strategy Pattern should be used (input/output for instance)
Only represent the major decisions: major classes, data structures, relationship, abstraction, encapsulation, etc
DON'T need return types, all getters and setters, types of parameters, etc. -->

How to address changes in:
○ Major classes --> **Add concrete class**
○ Key attributes and methods
○ Relationships among modules
