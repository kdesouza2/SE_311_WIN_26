Abstraction: the art of creation

From SE 310 -- Maze Game
    MapSite is the most important abstraction choice, because it enables polymorphism. Without MapSite, room, wall and door would be bound 
    to a specific layout. However, since we have MapSite we can create many different layouts without touching the room, wall or door classes

Modularization
~ Module-related decisions:
    How to split files into folders/namespaces
    How to split methods into classes
    How to make different modules/classes work together

Information Hiding:
~ The principle of segregation of the design decisions in a computer program that are most likely to change, 
    thus protecting other parts of the program from extensive 

Module:
~ An independent task assignment
~ An independent evovable unit
~ No matter how it is oriented
~ Separated by interfaces
