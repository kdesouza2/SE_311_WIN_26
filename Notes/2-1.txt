From SE 310 -- Maze Game
    MapSite is the most important abstraction choice, because it enables polymorphism. Without MapSite, room, wall and door would be bound 
    to a specific layout. However, since we have MapSite we can create many different layouts without touching the room, wall or door classes

    How to split files into folders/namespaces
    How to split methods into classes
    How to make different modules/classes work together
