Why do we need to model?
1. Analyze
    Changeability
    Performance
    Security
    Availability
    Reliability

2. Software is invisible
    Different analysis requires different models
    3 categories:
        Module (static, compile-time)
        Component-connector (dynamic, runtime)
        Allocation (hardware, team)
