Why do we need to model?
1. Analyze
    ~Changeability
    ~Performance
    ~Security
    ~Availability
    ~Reliability

2. Software is invisible
    ~Different analysis requires different models
    ~3 categories:
        ~Module (static, compile-time)
        ~Component-connector (dynamic, runtime)
        ~Allocation (hardware, team)

4+1 View
1. Use Case View --> Use Case, User Scenarios
    ~The center/determines the other views
    ~This view represents the scenarios that tie the four views together and form the reason why all the other views exists
    ~This view seems reducdant (hence +1). However, it represents the architecturally significant requirements (ASR) in the form of scenarios

    User Scenarios
        ~Light-weighted use case specification
        ~Starting point of implementation
        ~Maps to features
        ~Form a separate type of issue tickets
        ~Can be used to track productivity and quality
            ~Separate ticket types
            ~Link commits to ticket numbers
            ~Can be used to assign tasks
        ~The starting point of data-driven project management

        What makes a good user scenario?
            ~Always starts with a subject, matching one of the actors in the user case diagram 
            ~Active tense
            ~Specify concrete actions
            ~Specify the what not the how
