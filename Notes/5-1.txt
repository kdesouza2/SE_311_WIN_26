### Design Rule Theory and DSM

**1. Software Product Family**
    Use Hierarchy

**2. Design Structure Matrix (DSM)**
    Model composite elements
    Model heterogeneous dependencies
    Model various design structures
    Model independent modules created by design rules

Modular Operator: Splitting

**Software Architecture Style**
1. Pipes and filters
    A filter is a program/component
    A pipe is a way to interconnect two filters 
    
    A pipe-and-filter architecture fundamentally assumes linear, stream oriented, stateless (or weakly stateful) data transformation
    You should NOT use P&F if you have a following system:
        Highly interative, event-driven systems
        Systems with strong shared mutable state --> they share a data entity
        Control-Intensive, Decision-Heavy Systems 
        Real-Time systems with Hard Deadlines
        Systems requiring tight component coordination

2. Implicit Invocation

3. Layered Systems

4. Blackboard Style

5. Client-server -> cloud computing

6. 2-Tier -> 3-tier

7. Peer-to-Peer

8. Microservice
